                If the food looks yummy, the food would be scrumptious, delicious, delectable, luscious,
                great tasting, much more than tasty, really appetizing, lip-smacking; the kind of food to
                have you licking your lips in anticipation. This is the word everyone wants to hear when bringing 
                food to the table. Yummy food is never unpalatable, plain tasting, distasteful or disgusting.
                Food with a vinegary flavor would taste like vinegar. It would be acetous, sour, acid, acidic, tart, 
                astringent, pungent, harsh, acrid; never sweet.
